## üìä Dashboard UI Layout ‚Äì Structure-Focused Overview**

The dashboard UI layout is designed to present key metrics, visualizations, and activity data in a **clear, modular, and responsive format**. It balances high-level summaries with detailed views and allows users to navigate across different sections with ease.

### üß± **Core Layout Structure**

#### **1. Sidebar Navigation (Vertical)**

* Fixed vertical menu on the left.
* Organized into primary sections such as:

  * Overview / Home
  * Metrics or Analytics
  * Sessions / Records
  * Messaging or Communication
  * Settings and Support
* Includes:

  * User profile/avatar at the top
  * Company or team logo
  * Optional notification badges for activity (e.g., unread messages or new entries)

#### **2. Top Header Bar**

* Stretches across the top of the main content area.
* Includes:

  * Current page or breadcrumb navigation (e.g., ‚ÄúDashboard / Overview‚Äù)
  * Date or range filter (e.g., ‚ÄúToday‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù)
  * Global search
  * Icons for notifications, user profile, theme toggle, etc.

#### **3. Main Dashboard Area**

* Arranged using a responsive grid layout.
* Contains the following types of components:

##### **a. Summary Cards / Metric Widgets**

* Small, self-contained cards displaying:

  * Key figures or stats (e.g., total sessions, average performance, attendance count)
  * Comparison indicators (e.g., up/down percentages from previous period)
  * Optional mini visualizations (e.g., micro bar or line charts)

##### **b. Visual Charts**

* **Donut or Pie Charts**: Used for showing proportional data (e.g., session types, skill focus distribution)
* **Line or Area Charts**: Used for displaying time-based trends (e.g., progression over weeks, monthly activity)

##### **c. Data Tables**

* Structured tabular components for listing entries such as:

  * Swimmers, session logs, recorded times, feedback entries
* Columns may include:

  * Name or label
  * Timestamps
  * Quantitative values (e.g., lap count, distance, time)
  * Status indicators or tags

##### **d. Action or Promotion Panel (Optional)**

* A dedicated card or section for:

  * Highlighting features, training plans, motivational tips, or quick actions (e.g., ‚ÄúStart Session‚Äù)
  * Can include a call-to-action button or quick info

---

### ‚ûï **Optional Right-Side Panel**

* A secondary sidebar that may include:

  * **Notifications:** New activity, updates, or alerts
  * **Activity Feed:** A timeline of recent actions
  * **Contacts or Quick Access List:** Teammates, coaches, or admins with call/message icons

---

### üì± **Responsive Design Considerations**

* **Modular Cards:** Stack vertically on smaller screens
* **Tables:** Scrollable or condensed into mobile-friendly views
* **Sidebars:** Collapsible or slide-in behavior for compact layouts

---

### üîß **Implementation-Friendly Notes**

To communicate with your development environment or code assistant:

* Use **component-based architecture**: Each widget (e.g., chart, card, table) should be modular and reusable.
* **Grid or Flexbox layout system** for arranging cards and content.
* **Charting library support** (e.g., Chart.js, ApexCharts, Recharts) for visualizations.
* **State-aware components**: Metric widgets should update dynamically based on selected filters or timeframes.
* **Support for theme switching** if desired (light/dark), but not structurally essential.
